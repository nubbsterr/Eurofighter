My very own basic AV running off signature-based detection and static heuristics (TBD).

# What is Eurofighter?
Eurofighter is my very own anti-virus software designed to run on the Windows operating system, featuring basic signature-based and heuristic detection methods. 

By no means is this project supposed to be a REAL anti-virus; it is a proof-of-concept to show my knowledge of 
1) How anti-virus detects and terminates malware.
2) How to evade malware.

Yes, I do plan to discuss how to evade Eurofighter, though that shouldn't be hard. Even Defender has [DefenderCheck](https://github.com/matterpreter/DefenderCheck) to deal with among other tools xD

# Project Status
I will start working on this when I find the time to; hopefully that will be soon since I've been wanting to start this for a very long time!

<strong>Everything as of now is still subject to change. I do plan for Eurofighter to run off signature-based detection 100%, but who knows if I can fit heuristics in there as well. Time will tell!</strong>
